						<p>
							Frontend web development is the process of creating the part of a website or a web
							application that a user can see and interact with. This is the reason it is also known
							as client side development. Frontend web development mainly consists of HTML, CSS, and
							Javascript.
						</p>
						<p>
							HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. In simple
							words HTML is used to create web pages. It is the skeleton of a web page.It is made of
							a series of elements which consists of tags and attributes. This is a sample
							boilerplate of HTML code
							<code class="code-block">
								<span class="code-block__span">&#10094;!DOCTYPE html&#10095;</span
								><span class="code-block__span">&#10094;html&#10095;</span
								><span class="code-block__span"> &#10094;head&#10095;</span
								><span class="code-block__span">&#10094;/head&#10095;</span
								><span class="code-block__span"> &#10094;body&#10095;</span
								><span class="code-block__span">&#10094;/body&#10095;</span
								><span class="code-block__span">&#10094;/html&#10095;</span>
							</code>
							The <code class="code-block__inline">&#10094;!DOCTYPE html&#10095;</code> is written
							to declare or instruct the browser that this document is the HTML5 version. After this
							the html document includes the actual <code class="code-block__inline">html</code> tag
							which contains the <code class="code-block__inline">head</code> tag and the
							<code class="code-block__inline">body</code> tag. The head tag includes metadata,
							title of the page, and also the external link to a css file. The
							<code class="code-block__inline">body</code> tag includes the actual markup which is
							displayed to the user. This is what the current page with only html looks like.
						</p>
						<img src="/images/html.png" alt="plain-html" class="container-image" />
						<figcaption>This is what HTML without CSS would look like</figcaption>
						<p>
							Looks ugly right. This is where CSS comes in. CSS or <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle
							<b>S</b>heets. CSS is used for styling and positoning elements on a website. CSS uses
							selectors like a tag selector, class selector, or an id selector to target html
							elements and style them accordingly. CSS can be written inline within html elements or
							you can write a internal stylesheet in the head section of the html. Another way to
							attach CSS, which is also the most recommended one, is to write an external stylesheet
							and attach it. This is what a CSS style tag looks like
							<code class="code-block"
								><span class="code-block__span">body {</span
								><span class="code-block__span">background-color: red</span>
								<span class="code-block__span">}</span></code
							>
							This code above will set the body element's background color to red. There are also
							CSS frameworks online like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Bulma which makes design easy.
							These frameworks are pre-written libraries which can be used by linking them to the
							HTML file and just using the pre-written CSS class names to style the desired element.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now you must be thinking what is Javascript? Javascript is a programming language used
							to make your web page interactive. Did you click the image above to zoom in? If not
							give it a try. That is an example of Javascript. Whenever you visit a website there
							are a lot of interactive elements which change when a user interacts with them, like
							clicking a button or logging into your favourite social media account or using the
							search bar in an e-commerce website etc. This is all done using javascript. Javascript
							targets elements and uses logic to make the element interact when a user interacts
							with them. This is how a typical javascript selector looks like
							<code class="code-block"
								><span class="code-block__span"
									>var varName = document.querySelector('selector');</span
								></code
							>
							Javascript also uses frameworks and libraries like React.js, Angular, or Vue which
							allows easier development of web applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							To summarize HTML makes the skeleton of a webpage or a web application, CSS styles the
							html and makes it presentable, and javascript makes it interactive. These three
							complete the front-end part of the web.
