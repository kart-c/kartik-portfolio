							Frontend web development is the process of creating the part of a website or a web
							application that a user can see and interact with. This is the reason it is also known
							as client side development. Frontend web development mainly consists of HTML, CSS, and
							Javascript.
						</p>
						<p>
							HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. In simple
							words HTML is used to create web pages. It is the skeleton of a web page.It is made of
							a series of elements which consists of tags and attributes. This is what the current
							page with only html looks like.
						</p>
						<img src="/images/html.png" alt="plain-html" class="container-image" />

							Looks ugly right. This is where CSS comes in. CSS or <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle
							<b>S</b>heets. CSS is used for styling and positoning elements on a website. It is how
							you make your website presentable to the users. CSS uses selectors to target html
							elements and style them accordingly. CSS can be written inline within html elements or
							you can write a internal stylesheet in the head section of the html. Another way to
							attach CSS, which is also the most recommended one, is to write an external stylesheet
							and attach it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now you must be thinking what is Javascript? Javascript is a programming language used
							to make your web page interactive. Did you click the image above to zoom in or did you
							squint your eyes to read what it says? That is an example of Javascript. Whenever you
							visit a website there a lot of interactive elements which change when a user interacts
							with them. This is done using javascript.
						</p>
						<p>To summarize think of HTML as noun, CSS as adjective and javascript as a verb.</p>
